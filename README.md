Predictive Analytics for Stroke Prediction

• Employed data mining techniques including Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation (LRCV), K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Classification Trees (CT) to analyze a dataset of 5,110 patients across 12 attributes for stroke prediction.  
• Evaluated model performance both pre and post-application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to assess its impact on prediction accuracy and model robustness.  
• Achieved a highest accuracy rate of 83.57% using the kNN approach, highlighting the importance of feature selection and model choice.  
• Found that the application of SMOTE resulted in a more robust but slightly less accurate Logistic Regression and Classification Trees models, underscoring the trade-off between overfitting and generalization.  
• Identified age as a key predictor variable in stroke risk, informing potential future interventions or focus areas for healthcare providers.
